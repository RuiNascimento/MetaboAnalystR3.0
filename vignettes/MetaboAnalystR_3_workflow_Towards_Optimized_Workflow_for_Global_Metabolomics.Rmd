### 1. Introduction of MetaboAnalystR 3.0

**MetaboAnalystR 3.0** is aimed to optimize three important points for the whole pipeline. First, raw spectral processing parameters optimization. Second, we have enhanced the ability to correct batch effect by organising different algorithm. In addition, strengthened support for functional interpretation directly from m/z peaks via mummichog2 (PMID: 23861661) by integrating RT to refine the grouping of signals. To demonstrate this new functionality, we provide the "MetaboAnalystR 3.0 Workflow: Enhanced Global Metabolomics Analysis" vignette here. 

In this vignette, we are going to perform end-to-end metabolomics data analysis on (Case 1) example samples of clinical IBD samples from <https://www.ibdmdb.org/> and (Case 2) standards' mixture (PMID: 29907290). Case 1 is series facel samples from IBD (including CD and UC) and nonIBD controls. Case 2 is a dataset comprimised of 1100 standard compounds under the detection of UPLC-Q/E.

### 2. Case Study 1
Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, have affected several million individuals around the world. Jason L. et al. have performed a longtitude multiomics study on the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of IBD. Metabolomics study on the facal samples is introduced here for benchmark study of this noval parameters optimization pipeline.

### 2.1 Raw Data Processing
Raw data processing is the first for all metabolomics studies. MetaboAnalystR 3.0 support ".mzXML", ".mzML" and ".CDF" formats. The original formats (e.g. *.raw", ".RAW") generated by vendors will be supported soon. You can convert your original data with ProteoWizard (PMID: 23051804) as the supported formats. Centroided data is prefered.

#### 2.1.1 Load MetaboAnalystR 3.0

If you have finished the installation and been ready to use the package. Use the library() function to load the package into R. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the MetaboAnalystR package
library("MetaboAnalystR")
<<<<<<< HEAD
data_folder_Sample <- "D:/metaboanalystR3.0/9. MS_example/sample_data"
data_folder_QC <- "D:/metaboanalystR3.0/9. MS_example/QC_data"  
=======

```


#### 2.1.2 Download IBD Example QC Data

The example Quality Control (QC) samples will be used for the next steps. Download the MS data for parameters' optimization at this step. To reach a goal of quicking learning and avoid the long time running for the whole samples (over 600 samples). We only provide 5 samples for each CD and nonIBD group here. If you want to repeat and verify the results in our manuscript, please go [IBD MultiOmics Database](https://www.ibdmdb.org/), download the full batch data and run them using this pipeline.

```{r}
## Setting the data saving folder
data_folder_Sample <- "/home/xialab/Downloads/Data_IBD"
data_folder_QC <- "/home/xialab/Downloads/QC_IBD"  
```




```{r, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, include=FALSE}
# Use Google API for data downloading here. Please "install.packages('googledrive')" and "install.packages('httpuv')"first.
library(googledrive);
temp <- Ttempfile(fileext = ".zip")
# Please authorize your google account to access the data
dl <- drive_download(
  as_id("10DBpPEWy2cZyXvmlLOIfpwqQYwFplKYK"), path = temp, overwrite = TRUE)
# Setting your own date file folder
data_folder_QC <- "D:/metaboanalystR3.0/9. MS_example/sample_data"  
out <- unzip(temp, exdir = data_folder_QC)
# Date files for parameters optimization are deposited below
out

```


```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Now, download the small example data for comparison between CD vs. nonIBD
temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip")
dl <- drive_download(
  as_id("1-wlFUkzEwWX1afRWLJlY_KEJs7BfsZim"), path = temp, overwrite = TRUE)
# Setting the date file folder
data_folder_Sample <- "/home/qiang/Downloads/Data_IBD"
out <- unzip(temp, exdir = data_folder_Sample)
# Date files for normal processing example are deposited below
out

```

#### 2.1.3 Data Inspectation

Before running the data analysis, the general data structure and information can be inspected with *PerformDataInspect*. If there are some extremly significant contaminats, it will be discovered directly.

```{r,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Inspect the MS data via a 3D image. "res" are used to specify the resolution for the MS data.
PerformDataInspect(data_folder_QC,res = 50)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("0020a_XAV_iHMP2_FFA_PREFA02.mzXML","\n",'[1] "RT range is: 18.0985 and 1139.81 seconds !"',"\n",'[1] "MZ range is: 69.999908447266 and 849.902038574219 Thomson !"',"\n")
```

```{r echo=F, fig.width = 60}
knitr::include_graphics("datainspect.png")
```


#### 2.1.4 Data Trimming
QC samples data trimming was performed with *PerformDataTrimming* now. THere are 3 modes for data trimming. Default is Standard Simulation Method (ssm). UNder this mode, the 3D MS will trimmed from m/z demionsion firstly and then from RT deminson. rt.idx could be used to adjust the RT range for RT data reminning. The ohter 2 modes, which are named as "rt_specific" and "mz_specific" can be used to extracte (with positive values) or remove (with negative values). Trimmed MS file can be saved with *write = T*. The chromatogram can be plotted with *plot = T*.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# QC samples are trimmed with "ssm" strategy. The percentage of RT dimension retained is set as 25%.
raw_data <- PerformDataTrimming(data_folder_QC,rt.idx = 0.2)

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("Data Loaded !

#### 2.1.5 Initalize Parameters' Setting

Instrument specific initial parameters have been embedded. Currently, the most popular platforms that include UPLC-Q/E, UPLC-Q/TOF, UPLC-T/TOF, UPLC-Ion_trap, UPLC-Orbitrap, UPLC-G2S, HPLC-Q/TOF, HPLC-Ion_Trap, HPLC-Orbitrap and HPLC-S/Q. If your platform is not listed here, the "general" option can be applied for this setting. Besides, the specific parameters could also be set individually, if you have your own opinion about the parameters. This parameters optimization steps can be skipped.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=F}
# Initial platform specific parameters
param_initial <- SetPeakParam(platform = "UPLC-Q/E") 

```

#### 2.1.6 Parameters' Optimization

Parameters optimization with "ssm" strategy. Initial parameters are from the internal embeded parameters set.

```{r, echo=T, eval=FALSE}
# Select relative core according to your work platform
param_optimized <- PerformParamsOptimization(raw_data, param = param_initial, ncore = 8) 
# Following results was generated at the Ubuntu 18.04.4 with 64 GB RAM and Interl Core i7-9700 CPU

#### 2.1.7 Peak Profiling

The *ImportRawMSData* function reads in raw MS data files and saves it as an OnDiskMSnExp object. Two plots can be output with *plotSetting* function set with "Plot = T" - the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) which provides an overview of the entire spectra, and the Base Peak Chromatogram (BPC) which is a cleaner profile of the spectra based on the most abundant signals. These plots are useful to inform the setting of parameters downstream. For users who wish to view a peak of interest, an Extracted Ion Chromatogram (EIC) can be generated using the *PlotEIC* function.

```{r,echo=T, eval=FALSE}
# Import raw MS data. The "plotsetting" parameters can be used to determine plot or not.
rawData <- ImportRawMSData(data_folder_Sample,plotSettings = plotSetting(Plot=F))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat('[1] "The number of CPU cores to be used is set to 6."
[1] "Successfully imported raw MS data!"')
```

The *PerformPeakProfiling* function is an updated peak processing pipeline from XCMS R functions that performs peak detection, alignment, and grouping in an automatical step. The function also generates two diagnostic plots including statistics on the total intensity of peaks in different samples, a retention time adjustment map, and a PCA plot showing the overall sample clustering prior to data cleaning and statistical analysis.

```{r,echo=T, eval=FALSE}
# Peak Profiling with optimized parameters
mSet <- PerformPeakProfiling(rawData,param_optimized$best_parameters,plotSettings = plotSetting(Plot = T))

```

#### 2.1.8 Peak Annotation

The *PerformPeakAnnotation* function annotates isotope and adduct peaks with the method from CAMERA (PMID: 22111785). It outputs the result as a CSV file (“annotated_peaklist.csv”) and saves the annotated peaks to mSet object. Finally, the peak list is formatted to the correct structure for MetaboAnalystR and filtered based upon user’s specifications using the *FormatPeakList* function. This function permits the filtering of adducts (i.e. removal of all adducts except for [M+H]+/[M-H]-) and filtering of isotopes (i.e. removal of all isotopes except for monoisotopic peaks). The goal of filtering peaks is to remove degenerative signals and reduce the file size.

```

### 2.2 Data Processing and Statistical Analysis
Remaining in the same working directory, we will read in the filtered peak table. Then, we will replace missing values with a small value (half of the minimum positive value within the original data). Next we will filter varibles out non-informative signals, then normalize the samples to their median and perform log transformation. Finally, we will perform t-test analysis to identify differentially enriched features, setting the FDR-adjusted p-value threshold to 0.25.

#### 3.4 Remove An Extremly High-Intensity contaminant
Obviously, there are a series extremly high intensity peaks with mz 157.035, 158.035 and 159.035. According to experiment procedure, we can easily know the peaks are generated by DMSO, the solevent used as a stock solution. In this case, if we optimize the parameters blindly, the parameters will be dominated by this contaminants. Therefore, in order to obtain an unbiased efficacy, we 'd better to remove them at beginning.

```{r,echo=T,eval=F}
# This step is used to remove the high-intensity contaminant - DMSO [2*M+H] and its isotopes
