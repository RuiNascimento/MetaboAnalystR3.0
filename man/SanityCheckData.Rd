SanityCheckData(mSetObj=NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{mSetObj}{Input the name of the created mSetObj (see InitDataObjects)}
}
\description{
SanityCheckData is used for data processing, and performs a basic sanity 
check of the uploaded content, ensuring that the data is suitable for further analysis. 
The function will return a message if the data has successfully passed the check
and is deemed suitable for further analysis. If it fails, the function will return a 0.
The function will perform the check directly onto the mSet$dataSet object, and must 
be performed immediately after reading in data. 
The sanity check function evaluates the accuracy of sample and class labels, data structure, 
deals with non-numeric values, removes columns that are constant across all samples (variance = 0), 
and by default replaces missing values with half of the original minimal positive value in your dataset.
