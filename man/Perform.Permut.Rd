\title{Perform permutation tests only for ROC Tester}
\usage{
Perform.Permut(mSetObj=NA, perf.measure, perm.num, propTraining = 2/3)
}
\arguments{
\item{mSetObj}{Input the name of the created mSetObj (see InitDataObjects)}

\item{perf.measure}{Input the performance measure to rate the performance of the model, either the area
under the ROC curve ("auroc") or the predictive accuracy ("accu")}

\item{perm.num}{Input the number of permutations to perform}

\item{propTraining}{Numeric, input the fraction of samples to set aside for training. Default is set to 2/3.}
