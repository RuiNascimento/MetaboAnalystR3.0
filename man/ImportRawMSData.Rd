\title{Import raw MS data}
\usage{
ImportRawMSData(foldername, mode = "onDisk", ncores = 4, plotSettings)
}
\arguments{
\item{foldername}{Character, input the file path to the folder containing
the raw MS spectra to be processed.}

\item{mode}{Character, the data input mode. Default is "onDisk" to avoid memory crash. "inMemory" will 
absorb data into the memory.}

\item{plotSettings}{List, plotting parameters produced by SetPlotParam Function. "plot.opts" can be added through this 
function for samples numbers for plotting. Defalut is "default", "all" will apply all samples for plotting and may cause 
memory crash, especially for large sample dataset.}
}
\description{
This function handles the reading in of 
raw MS data (.mzML, .CDF and .mzXML). Users must set 
their working directory to the folder containing their raw 
data, divided into two subfolders named their desired group labels. The  
function will output two chromatograms into the user's working directory, a 
base peak intensity chromatogram (BPIC) and a total ion 
chromatogram (TIC). Further, this function sets the number of cores
to be used for parallel processing. It first determines the number of cores 
within a user's computer and then sets it that number/2.
