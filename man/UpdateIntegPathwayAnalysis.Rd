\title{Update integrative pathway analysis for new input list}
\usage{
UpdateIntegPathwayAnalysis(mSetObj=NA, qids, file.nm, topo="dc", enrich="hyper", libOpt="integ")
}
\arguments{
\item{mSetObj}{Input name of the created mSet Object}

\item{qids}{Input the query IDs}

\item{file.nm}{Input the name of the file}

\item{topo}{Select the mode for topology analysis: Degree Centrality ("dc") measures the number of links that connect to a node 
(representing either a gene or metabolite) within a pathway; Closeness Centrality ("cc") measures the overall distance from a given node 
to all other nodes in a pathway; Betweenness Centrality ("bc")measures the number of shortest paths from all nodes to all the others that pass through a given node within a pathway.}

\item{enrich}{Method to perform over-representation analysis (ORA) based on either hypergenometrics analysis ("hyper")
or Fisher's exact method ("fisher").}

\item{libOpt}{Select the different modes of pathways, either the gene-metabolite mode ("integ") which allows for joint-analysis
and visualization of both significant genes and metabolites or the gene-centric ("genetic") and metabolite-centric mode ("metab") which allows users
to identify enriched pathways driven by significant genes or metabolites, respectively.}

used for integrative analysis
